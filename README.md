# ReasonReact Template & Examples

This is:
- A template for your new ReasonReact project.
- A collection of thin examples illustrating ReasonReact usage.
- Extra helper documentation for ReasonReact (full ReasonReact docs [here](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/)).

`src` contains 4 sub-folders, each an independent, self-contained ReasonReact example. Feel free to delete any of them and shape this into your project! This template's more malleable than you might be used to =).

The point of this template and examples is to let you understand and personally tweak the entirely of it. We **don't** give you an opaque, elaborate mega build setup just to put some boxes on the screen. It strikes to stay transparent, learnable, and simple. You're encouraged to read every file; it's a great feeling, having the full picture of what you're using and being able to touch any part.

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm run server
# in a new tab
npm start
```

Open a new web page to `http://localhost:8000/`. Change any `.re` file in `src` to see the page auto-reload. **You don't need any bundler when you're developing**!

**How come we don't need any bundler during development**? We highly encourage you to open up `index.html` to check for yourself!

# Deployment

```sh
npm run webpack # bundles for production
npm run deploy  # deploys `build` directory to gh-pages branch
```

# Handle Routing Yourself

To serve the files, this template uses a minimal dependency called `moduleserve`. A URL such as `localhost:8000/scores/john` resolves to the file `scores/john.html`. If you'd like to override this and handle URL resolution yourself, change the `server` command in `package.json` from `moduleserve ./ --port 8000` to `moduleserve ./ --port 8000 --spa` (for "single page application"). This will make `moduleserve` serve the default `index.html` for any URL. Since `index.html` loads `Index.bs.js`, you can grab hold of the URL in the corresponding `Index.re` and do whatever you want.

By the way, ReasonReact comes with a small [router](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/router) you might be interested in.
